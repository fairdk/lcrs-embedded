"""
Models in the protocol
======================

The protocol itself is embedded in JSON requests transmitted through an HTTP
server.

All classes in this module are fully serializable back and forth.

These are the states of an embedded server and can be observed by the
requesting attendant client.

    Overall assumption: To simplify our understanding of hardware data found by

    YAGNI mentality: Try to make stuff that's simple, dump advanced stuff into
    raw output and improve the protocol in the future.

    to worry about things breaking in this interface.
